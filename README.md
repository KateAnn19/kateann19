I'm a software developer in Boulder, Colorado. I love solving problems and designing awesome websites and products. I was an ABA therapist working with kids and adults with autism before switching to software development, and I use the perspective I gained from that field to improve user experience and accessibility for all types of users. My focus and tenacity I sharpened in working in ABA helps me stay focused in my daily work and gives me the strength to push past roadblocks and not give up until I've solved something. I also have OCD. My OCD is a curse in some ways and a blessing in others. I'm looking to join a team that has solid practices, challenges and allows me to grow, believes in work/life balance and strives to do things in the best way possible.
